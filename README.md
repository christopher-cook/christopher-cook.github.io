Movie Q's has access to a database of nearly 500k+ movie titles all sourced from [OMDB](http://omdbapi.com/). The purpose of this game is purely recreational and should be treated as such. Movie API requests are currently limited to 1000 queries per day which is more than adequate for beta purposes.
